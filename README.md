# Affordance

**Affordance:** the qualities or properties of an object that define its possible uses or make clear how it can or should be used.

For example, the handle on a coffee mug!

Every codebase inherently labels, organizes, and simplifies the complexities of the real world. This is done by people. This tool's goal is to take that organization and turn it into a visual format for much higher communication bandwidth/comprehension between different developers on the project over time. This is fundamentally a codebase storytelling tool.


Total WIP atm, trying to get it to a point where I can build the map I
need of an existing project of mine.
